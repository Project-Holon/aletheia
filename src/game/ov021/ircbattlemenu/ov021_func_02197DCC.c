 * Byte-correct (2026-10-01).  Sole blocker: the ABS32 pool word for the
 * ov021 table is a data start that another overlay mapped over the same
 * window also starts an object at, so the symbols hint is contested.  No C
 * change needed to promote.
 *
 * 2026-10-01: the own-overlay data hint is dropped from symbols: so the
 *   own-window rule (code running in ov021 can only see ov021's bytes in its
 *   window) fixes the overlay; with the hint the tool refused it as contested.
