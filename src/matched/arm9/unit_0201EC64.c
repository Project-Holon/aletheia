 * unit:     yes
 * address:  0x0201EC64
 * packet:   pkt_0201E4C8

 * isa:      thumb
 * status:   EXACT
 * function: GF_FONT_Create_EC64
 *
 * The first function of wordset.c.  The file identity is in the image: the
 * constructor at 0x0201EC74, immediately after this, passes 0x020A7364 to the
 * debug allocator at 0x02030734, and the bytes there spell "wordset.c".  The
 * string before it is "gf_font.c", whose terminator at 0x020A7360 plus three
 * bytes of padding fixes 0x020A7364 by construction, so the `string` class
 * carries the address; see src/matched/unit_0201ED04.c for the rest of the
 * file and the near miss at 0x0201EC74 that keeps this function on its own.
 *
 * Sixteen bytes: a pool-word-and-bx tail call
 * (docs/idioms/tail-call-is-a-pool-word-and-bx.md) that fills in the default
 * entry count 8 and the default per-entry string size 0x20.  It cannot be one
 * unit with 0x0201EC74 because that function is 14 bytes of prologue
 * scheduling away from EXACT and csrc.py refuses anything less.
 *
 * Addresses are Black-image addresses.  Nothing here reads a version flag or
 * a species table.
 *
 * Verified with:
 *   python tools/match.py tu --src src/matched/unit_0201EC64.c \
 *       --addr 0x0201EC64 --thumb
 *
 * symbols:
 *   WORDSET_Create  0x0201EC74  thumb
