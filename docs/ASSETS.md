# Asset inventory (lane 1: investigation)

This is the first asset-pipeline lane: pure investigation and inventory of the
247 NitroFS files under `extract/data/` (as unpacked by `tools/ndsrom.py`).
No asset converters exist yet. Everything below was produced by stdlib-only
tools written from scratch for this project: `tools/assets/narc.py` (NARC
container + BTAF/BTNF + LZ77/LZ11/Huffman/RLE decoders),
`tools/assets/inventory.py` (the per-file survey), `tools/assets/sdat.py`
(SDAT sound archive reader), and `tools/assets/verify_compression.py`
(whole-ROM Huffman/RLE round-trip check).

Run it yourself:

```
python tools/assets/inventory.py
```

This prints the table below to stdout and writes the full machine-readable
result (per-file magic/compression histograms, sizes) to
`build/assets/inventory.json` (gitignored; regenerate, don't commit).

To look inside one NARC:

```
python tools/assets/narc.py list extract/data/a/0/0/0
python tools/assets/narc.py info extract/data/a/0/0/0
python tools/assets/narc.py extract extract/data/a/0/0/0 2 -o build/assets/out.bin --decompress
```

## Format notes

### NARC container

A NARC is the NitroSDK "generic container" shape: a 16-byte file header,
then three fixed sections, each itself `magic(4) + size(4) + body`:

- **BTAF** (`u32 file_count` then `file_count` pairs of `(start, end)` u32
  offsets, relative to the byte right after the GMIF section header)
- **BTNF** (file name table; same directory-tree shape as the ROM's own FNT.
  Present in every NARC in this ROM. Not decoded into paths by this lane --
  the names are rarely informative for game-data archives and sub-file count
  and content are what matter for the inventory)
- **GMIF** (`magic + size` header, then the concatenated sub-file bytes)

`tools/assets/narc.py` parses all three sections and exposes sub-files by
index (offset, size, first-4-bytes magic). All 237 NARCs in this ROM parsed
cleanly with this layout; no variant section orders or missing sections were
seen.

### Compression header sniffing

Many sub-files (and a few whole top-level files) open with a BIOS-style
compression header: byte 0 is the type tag, bytes 1..3 are the 24-bit LE
decompressed size.

| tag | type | decoded in this lane? |
|---|---|---|
| 0x10 | LZ77 ("LZ77 UnComp") | yes |
| 0x11 | LZ11 | yes |
| 0x24 | Huffman, 4-bit | decoded (see below) |
| 0x28 | Huffman, 8-bit | decoded (see below) |
| 0x30 | RLE | decoded (see below) |

LZ77 and LZ11 were quick to write (both are simple forward-window token
streams, unrelated to `tools/blz.py`'s BLZ which is a *backward* LZ77 used
only for ARM9/overlays) and are included, self-checked against the header's
declared decompressed size on every sub-file scanned:

- **LZ11**: every sniffed instance across the sampled sub-files (4660+ during
  spot checks, 10794 total per the full inventory run) decoded and matched
  the declared size exactly. High confidence the decoder is correct.
- **LZ77**: 909 of 953 sniffed instances (out of 1522 total tag-0x10
  sub-files) decoded and matched the declared size; 44 raised a decode error
  (match offset before the start of output). Those are very likely **false
  positives of the sniff**, not decoder bugs: a tag byte of 0x10 with a
  plausible-looking 24-bit size can occur by chance in any binary blob
  (Game Freak's many custom formats have no magic and start with arbitrary
  bytes). `narc.py extract --decompress` reports these as errors rather than
  emitting garbage. Do not trust an LZ77 sniff blindly; verify the round trip
  before treating a hit as real.
- **Huffman/RLE**: decoded in this lane (`decompress_huffman()` for 0x24/
  0x28, `decompress_rle()` for 0x30, both in `tools/assets/narc.py`). See
  "Huffman/RLE decoder verification" below for the full result -- the
  short version is that the decoders are correct (verified against
  hand-built synthetic test vectors), but this ROM's NARCs contain
  essentially **no genuine BIOS-Huffman or BIOS-RLE compressed sub-files**:
  the tag-byte sniff used by the previous lane had a bug that made it match
  false positives, and after fixing the sniff, the small number of
  remaining tag matches are themselves almost all false positives (a tiny
  custom-format data record whose first byte coincidentally looks like a
  compression header).

### Huffman/RLE decoder verification

`tools/assets/narc.py` now implements `decompress_huffman()` (BIOS-style
0x24 four-bit and 0x28 eight-bit variants, per the public GBATEK-documented
tree-table algorithm: a byte0 type/width tag, 24-bit declared size, a
tree-size byte, a binary tree of 8-bit nodes reached by walking a 32-bit-word
bitstream MSB-first, data units packed LSB-first into output bytes) and
`decompress_rle()` (0x30: alternating compressed-run/literal-run blocks).
Both were validated two ways:

1. **Synthetic self-test** (not committed as a test file, run ad hoc): a
   hand-built 3-symbol Huffman8 tree (root node with two leaf children) and
   a hand-built RLE stream (one compressed run + one literal run) both
   decoded to the exact expected bytes. This confirms the decoder logic
   itself is correct against the documented algorithm.
2. **Whole-ROM scan** (`tools/assets/verify_compression.py`, run over every
   NARC in `extract/data/`): found and attempted to decode every sub-file
   whose first byte matches a Huffman or RLE tag, comparing decoded length
   against the header's declared size.

While writing the verifier, a **bug was found and fixed** in
`sniff_compression()`: the previous lane's condition for recognising a
Huffman tag accidentally matched bare byte `0x20` (which is not a valid
Huffman header -- the low nibble must be 4 or 8, since it encodes the
data-unit width) instead of the intended `0x24`/`0x28`. `0x20` is the ASCII
space character, so this sniff was mostly firing on `a/0/0/6`'s `" APS"`
trainer-sprite wrapper magic (byte 0 is the space in `" APS"`) -- explaining
the previous lane's reported "800 Huffman4 sub-files, all in `a/0/0/6`".
None of those 800 are real Huffman data; `narc.py`'s sniff now requires
`(tag & 0xF0) == 0x20 and (tag & 0x0F) in (4, 8)`.

With the fixed sniff, the whole-ROM scan finds far fewer candidates, and
almost none decode cleanly:

| kind | tag matches found | decoded size == declared | notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Huffman4 (0x24) | 21 | 3 | the 3 "passes" all declare 0-13 bytes of output -- too small to be meaningful confirmation, likely also coincidental |
| Huffman8 (0x28) | 62 | 8 | same caveat: passes are all 0-2 declared bytes |
| RLE (0x30) | 32 | 7 | passes are 0-1 declared bytes |

Every *failing* match has an absurd implied compression ratio (e.g. a
16-byte sub-file "declaring" an 88,322-byte decompressed size -- physically
impossible for BIOS RLE, whose maximum ratio is about 65:1), which is the
signature of a tag byte matching by chance inside a small, fixed-size
Game Freak data record rather than a real compression header. All of these
false positives live in the NARCs already flagged in the inventory as
"text banks (guess)" / "scripts/data tables (guess)" -- archives of
hundreds of tiny (2-180 byte) per-entry binary records, exactly where a
1-in-256-ish coincidental tag match is expected to turn up occasionally.

**Conclusion: this ROM's extracted NARCs contain no confirmed genuine
BIOS-Huffman or BIOS-RLE compressed sub-file.** The decoders are written,
correct, and ready for the moment a real one turns up (e.g. inside an
as-yet-unopened custom wrapper, or a file this lane didn't scan), but there
is currently no confirmed asset that needs them. This directly overturns
the previous lane's inventory claim of "832 Huffman/RLE sub-files" and the
"trainer sprites are Huffman4-compressed" theory for `a/0/0/6` (see below).

### NITRO/G3D magics observed

Sub-file magics are stored "reversed" on disk (e.g. tile data is bytes
`RGCN`, the resource named NCGR read backwards):

| on-disk | resource | count (all NARCs) |
|---|---|---:|
| `RLCN` | NCLR (palette) | 4232 |
| `RECN` | NCER (cell bank) | 3274 |
| `RCMN` | NMCR, multi-cell resource (guess) | 2960 |
| `RAMN` | NMAR, multi-cell animation resource (guess) | 2960 |
| `RGCN` | NCGR (tile/character data) | 1880 |
| `BTX0` | NSBTX (texture) | 1341 |
| `RCSN` | NSCR (screen/map) | 503 |
| `BMD0` | NSBMD (model) | 413 |
| `RNAN` | NANR (cell animation) | 314 |
| `BCA0` | NSBCA (joint animation) | 258 |
| `BTA0` | NSBTA (texture SRT animation) | 187 |
| `BTP0` | NSBTP (texture pattern animation) | 112 |
| `BMA0` | NSBMA (material color animation) | 69 |
| `BVA0` | NSBVA (visibility animation) | 31 |
| `SDAT` | sound archive (top-level or embedded) | 3 |
| `SBNK`/`SSEQ`/`SWAR` | SDAT sub-chunks (bank/sequence/wave archive) | 4 each |

`RCMN`/`RAMN` are a guess at the expansion (by analogy with `RECN`/`RNAN` ->
NCER/NANR, "multi-cell" and "multi-cell-animation" is the most consistent
reading of their pairing with NCER/NANR in the same archives, but this is
**not verified** against any spec). None of these needed a footnote from
outside documentation; all read directly off the bytes.

28641 sub-files (about half the total) carry **no** recognisable magic and
**no** compression header: Game Freak's own custom formats (species/move/
item/trainer data tables, scripts, text, and a few oddities like `RIFF`-
tagged blobs in `a/2/1/2`). Decoding any of these is out of scope for this
lane.

## Inventory summary

- **247** NitroFS files: **237 NARC**, **10 raw** (a single blob, or an
  unrecognised format)
- **54054** total sub-files across all NARCs
- Compression histogram across all sub-files (corrected -- see "Huffman/RLE
  decoder verification" above; the original `Huffman4` figure of 800 was a
  sniff bug, all 800 hits were false positives on `a/0/0/6`'s `" APS"`
  wrapper magic): `none` ~41693, `LZ11` 10794, `LZ77` 1522, `Huffman4` 21
  (tag matches, ~3 plausibly real), `Huffman8` 62 (tag matches, ~8
  plausibly real), `RLE` 32 (tag matches, ~7 plausibly real)
- Automated category-guess breakdown (heuristic over magic/count/size only,
  see `guess_category()` in `tools/assets/inventory.py`):

  | category guess | files |
  |---|---:|
  | scripts/data tables | 77 |
  | 3D model/texture data | 51 |
  | trainer/item/UI sprites | 30 |
  | small sprite/icon set | 30 |
  | map/tileset graphics | 18 |
  | text banks | 18 |
  | unknown raw format | 7 |
  | unknown | 5 |
  | pokemon/trainer sprites | 4 |
  | sound (SDAT archive) | 3 |
  | pokemon battle sprites | 2 |
  | single compressed blob | 2 |

The automated guess is coarse (it only looks at magic/count/size, not
content) and gets outranked below by manual, evidence-based candidates for
the specific categories this project cares about first. Treat the table
below as a starting index, not a verified map.

### Full per-file table

`path` is relative to `extract/data/`. `dominant formats` lists the top 2
sub-file magics by count (a blank entry means "no recognised magic, no
compression header": a raw custom-format sub-file; a `0x...` entry is a
hex dump of an unrecognised 4-byte magic).

### BTNF name table results

`tools/assets/narc.py`'s `Narc._parse_btnf()` now decodes the BTNF section
into a real `{file_id: path}` map (same directory-table shape as the ROM's
own FNT, see `tools/ndsrom.py`'s `parse_fnt()`), and each `SubFile` carries
its resolved `.name` when one exists. Scanning all 237 NARCs:

- **1 / 237 NARCs** has any usable BTNF names at all: `a/2/3/2`, whose
  single sub-file is named `battle_pocket.dat`.
- **1 / 54054** total sub-files carries a name.

This confirms the original inventory's note in passing ("sub-file names are
rarely meaningful for these game-data archives") -- essentially every NARC
in this ROM was built with an empty/degenerate BTNF subtable (root entry
present, no children), so BTNF decoding does not help disambiguate any of
the "uncertain category" archives discussed elsewhere in this document.
The one exception (`battle_pocket.dat`) is consistent with `a/2/3/2` being
UI-related data (a "pocket" of the bag/battle menu), for whatever that's
worth as a single data point.

### SDAT internal structure (`wb_sound_data.sdat`)

`tools/assets/sdat.py` (new, stdlib-only) parses the SDAT container: the
0x40-byte file header, then the SYMB (name tables), INFO (per-entry
metadata, counts only decoded here), FAT (absolute file offset/size table),
and FILE (raw sub-file data) blocks, per the public NitroSDK SDAT layout
(header + 4 named blocks; SYMB/INFO each hold 8 fixed-order record tables:
SEQ, SEQARC, BANK, WAVARC, PLAYER, GROUP, PLAYER2, STRM). Run it with:

```
python tools/assets/sdat.py extract/data/wb_sound_data.sdat --json build/assets/sdat_summary.json
```

Results for `wb_sound_data.sdat` (51,533,312 bytes, SYMB present, 3874 FAT
file entries):

| resource type | count |
|---|---:|
| SEQ (SSEQ, sequenced music/jingles/SFX-sequences) | 2076 |
| BANK (SBNK, instrument banks) | 1986 |
| WAVARC (SWAR, wave archives) | 1986 |
| PLAYER | 7 |
| GROUP | 1 |
| SEQARC, PLAYER2, STRM | 0 (none present) |

No `STRM` (streamed audio) entries exist in this archive.

**SEQ naming breakdown** (940 of 2076 SEQ slots have a SYMB name; the rest
are unnamed but still present, offset-0 name pointer):

| prefix | count | likely meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `SEQ_SE_...` | 726 | sound-effect sequences |
| `SEQ_BGM_...` | 179 | background music tracks |
| `SEQ_ME_...` | 32 | "music effect" jingles (level-up, evolution, etc.) |
| `SEQ_PV...` | 3 | unclear, only 3 instances |

**Cries identified with high confidence, by naming pattern in BANK/WAVARC,
not SEQ:** WAVARC (and BANK, in lockstep -- both tables are 1986 entries
long and indexed identically) slots **1 through 650** are named either
`WAVE_ARC_PV###` (494 of them, e.g. `WAVE_ARC_PV001`) or
`WAVE_ARC_PMWB_###` (156 of them, e.g. `WAVE_ARC_PMWB_657`, where `###` is
a species/form index). `PMWB` reads as "Pokemon [Black/White]". 494 + 156 =
**650**, matching Black/White's 649 species (+1, likely a 1-based index
with slot 0 reserved/empty). Slot 0 and every slot from 651 onward are
either unnamed or carry `WAVE_SE_...`/`BANK_SE_...` names (sound-effect
banks, e.g. `WAVE_SE_WB_FLD_176`, `WAVE_SE_WB_SYS_101`) -- i.e. the cry
block is a contiguous, cleanly-bounded index range at the front of the
BANK/WAVARC tables. This directly resolves the previous lane's "cries not
located" gap: **cries are `wb_sound_data.sdat` BANK/WAVARC entries 1-650**,
not a separate NARC and not SEQ sequences. Decoding the actual PCM sample
data out of those WAVARC entries (via FAT offset/size) is left to the SDAT
converter lane.

**Music vs. effects split (by SEQ naming, heuristic):** `SEQ_BGM_*` (179)
is music; `SEQ_SE_*` (726) and `SEQ_ME_*` (32) are effects/jingles played
through the sequence player (separate from the raw WAVARC sound-effect
banks used for cries and simple blips). This is a naming-pattern heuristic,
not verified by listening to decoded audio.

## Where things probably live (guesses, ranked by evidence)

These are the answers to "where do I find X to build the next converter
lane." All are guesses inferred from magic/count/size shape, not from any
outside file list or wiki. Confidence is noted per entry.

- **Pokemon overworld/menu character sprites -- `a/0/0/4` and `a/0/5/2`**
  (medium confidence). Both are ~14285 sub-files (identical count), ~8-9 MB,
  and are the only archives in the ROM with `NCER`+`NMCR`+`NMAR`+`NCLR`
  present together at scale (cell banks + multi-cell + multi-cell-animation
  resources + palettes, no `NCGR` tile chunks visible at the top magic
  level -- tiles are likely nested inside the custom-tagged/LZ11-compressed
  sub-blobs that dominate the histogram). 14285 / 649 species is about 22
  sub-resources per species, consistent with a walking/direction/animation
  sprite set rather than the two static battle-sprite frames. The two
  archives (near-identical shape, different sizes) are plausibly two
  variants, e.g. normal vs. shiny, or two resolutions.

- **Pokemon battle sprites -- `a/1/3/4`** (medium confidence). 670 sub-files
  (649 species plus formes/genders), **every** sub-file LZ11-compressed,
  average ~29 KB compressed each -- large enough for an animated multi-frame
  battle sprite, too few sub-files for a per-frame-per-species table. No
  legible magic inside (custom Game Freak tile format), so the pixel layout
  itself is still unknown.

- **Trainer sprites -- `a/0/0/6`** (medium confidence on location, **Huffman4
  theory retracted**). 733 sub-files (there are on the order of 700+ trainer
  classes in Black/White), average ~12 KB each -- consistent with a
  full-body trainer portrait. The on-disk magic tag is `" APS"` (i.e.
  reversed `"SPA "`), which does not match any known NITRO chunk, so this is
  Game Freak's own wrapper. **The previous lane's claim that every sub-file
  is Huffman4-compressed was a sniff false positive**: byte 0 of `" APS"` is
  the ASCII space `0x20`, which a bug in `sniff_compression()` matched as a
  (invalid) Huffman tag -- see "Huffman/RLE decoder verification" above.
  With the sniff fixed, these sub-files carry no recognised BIOS compression
  header at all; whatever compression (if any) Game Freak used for the
  pixel data lives *after* the `" APS"` header, and its shape has not been
  determined by this pass (the trainer-sprite loader/wrapper investigation
  was deferred to a future lane to stay within this pass's budget).

- **Pokemon icons (not confirmed as "item icons") -- `a/1/6/7`**
  (low-medium confidence). 655 sub-files, average only ~107 bytes each --
  small enough for a 4bpp icon-sized tile (e.g. 16x16 = 128 bytes). 655 is
  close to the species count (649) plus a handful of extras (egg icon,
  "?" icon), which favours species icons over item icons. **Item icons are
  not confidently located** -- no archive in the table has a sub-file count
  close to Black/White's item count (~638) with a similarly small average
  size and no better magic evidence; `a/0/7/2` (760 sub-files, ~326 B
  average) is the next-best candidate but the count doesn't line up as
  cleanly. This needs the next lane's actual pixel decoding to disambiguate.

- **Pokemon cries -- located, high confidence.** `wb_sound_data.sdat`'s
  BANK and WAVARC (SBNK/SWAR) tables carry entries 1-650 named
  `WAVE_ARC_PV###` / `WAVE_ARC_PMWB_###` (and the matching `BANK_PV###` /
  `BANK_SE...` on the BANK side) -- 650 = 649 Black/White species + 1. See
  "SDAT internal structure" above for the full breakdown. This was resolved
  by opening the SDAT SYMB/INFO block structure with the new
  `tools/assets/sdat.py`.

- **Music and sound effects -- `wb_sound_data.sdat`** (high confidence; see
  "SDAT internal structure" above for the actual SEQ_BGM/SEQ_SE/SEQ_ME
  naming split, now opened and no longer a guess). It is the only file with
  an `SDAT` magic at the top level and is by far the largest file in
  `extract/data/` (51.5 MB, versus the next-largest NARC at 19.5 MB). A
  handful of small NARCs (`a/1/4/0`, `a/1/4/2`, `skb.narc`,
  `soundstatus.narc`) also turned up incidentally but their dominant
  sub-file magics are graphics (`NCLR`/`NCGR`/`NSBTX`), not sound -- they are
  more likely UI elements *about* sound (e.g. a sound-test menu) than sound
  data itself.

- **Text banks -- uncertain, several candidates, none confirmed.** The
  automated heuristic flags 18 files as "text banks" purely because they
  have >500 sub-files and no graphics magic, but most of those
  (`a/0/1/6`, `a/0/1/8`, `a/0/1/9`, `a/0/2/0`, `a/0/2/1`, `a/0/2/4`,
  `a/0/9/2`, `a/0/9/3`, `a/1/2/3`, `a/1/6/9`, `a/1/9/4`, `a/2/1/4`) have a
  tiny average sub-file size (2-60 bytes) -- too small and too regular for
  variable-length message strings, and much more likely per-species/per-item
  **fixed-size binary data tables** (base stats, level-up moves, etc.), not
  text. The better text-bank candidates are the ones with a *larger and more
  variable* average size and no graphics/model magic: **`a/0/5/7`** (899
  sub-files, ~490 B average) and **`a/0/6/6`** (601 sub-files, ~717 B
  average). Neither is confirmed; confirming requires decoding Black/White's
  character encoding, which is out of scope for this lane.

## Proposed converter lane order

Ordered by (a) how well-understood the container/pixel format already is
from this inventory, and (b) how useful the output is for other lanes (e.g.
trainer/Pokemon sprites are useful reference material once other formats are
being reverse engineered against known visuals).

1. **NARC extraction lane** (mostly done): harden `tools/assets/narc.py`
   into a general extract-all-subfiles tool with LZ11/LZ77 auto-decompress,
   writing to `build/assets/<narc>/NNNN.bin`. Needed by every lane below.
2. **NCGR/NCLR/NSCR -> PNG (tilemap graphics)**: the best-understood format
   family here (4232 NCLR + 1880 NCGR + 503 NSCR instances, standard NITRO
   tile+palette+screen chunks with documented public layouts: tile depth,
   palette count, and screen entries are all in the chunk headers). Start
   with the small, clearly-identified archives (`a/0/0/0`, `a/0/2/2`,
   `skb.narc`, tileset-guess files) to validate the chunk parser before
   tackling the bigger, custom-wrapped sprite archives.
3. **Trainer sprites (`a/0/0/6`)**: needs a Huffman4 decoder (not written in
   this lane) plus whatever raw bitmap layout Game Freak wrapped around it.
   Medium difficulty, high payoff (700+ visually verifiable sprites make a
   good testbed for the custom tile format).
4. **Pokemon battle sprites (`a/1/3/4`)**: needs the LZ11 decoder (already
   written, `tools/assets/narc.py`) plus the same custom bitmap layout as
   (3). Verifiable against 649 well-known sprites.
5. **Pokemon overworld/menu sprites (`a/0/0/4`, `a/0/5/2`)**: needs NCER/
   NMCR/NMAR cell-animation decoding on top of (3)/(4)'s bitmap format --
   more moving parts, do after the static sprite formats are solid.
6. **NSBMD/NSBTX (3D models)**: well-identified (413 BMD0 + 1341 BTX0
   instances, public G3D chunk documentation exists), but lower priority
   since Black/White is a 2D game and these are a minority of assets
   (trophies, some battle backgrounds/effects).
7. **SDAT (sound)**: `wb_sound_data.sdat` is large and self-contained;
   needs its own INFO/STRM/section-table reader (not attempted here) before
   cries/music/SFX can be split out and converted.
8. **Text banks**: lowest priority for this list since even the *location*
   of the real text data is unconfirmed (see above) and decoding needs the
   character encoding table, which does not exist yet in this project.

## Known gaps / honesty notes

(Updated by the second asset-lane pass: Huffman/RLE decoders, BTNF
decoding, and SDAT internals were closed out this pass; the trainer-sprite
wrapper investigation in `a/0/0/6` was deferred to stay within budget.)

- Category guesses throughout this document and `inventory.json` are
  heuristic and explicitly labelled "(guess)". None have been confirmed by
  actually decoding and viewing pixels, text, or audio.
- BTNF is now decoded into real paths (`Narc._parse_btnf()` in
  `tools/assets/narc.py`), but it turned out not to help: only 1 of 54054
  sub-files across all 237 NARCs carries a name (`a/2/3/2`'s single
  sub-file, `battle_pocket.dat`). See "BTNF name table results" above.
- SDAT internal structure (SYMB/INFO/FAT/FILE inside `wb_sound_data.sdat`)
  is now opened by `tools/assets/sdat.py`: counts, names, and a cry/music/
  effect split by naming pattern are in "SDAT internal structure" above.
  Not yet done: decoding the actual SSEQ/SBNK/SWAR/PCM payloads (only the
  container-level table of contents was read).
- Huffman4/Huffman8/RLE decoders are now implemented
  (`decompress_huffman()`, `decompress_rle()` in `tools/assets/narc.py`)
  and validated against hand-built synthetic test vectors. However, a sniff
  bug in the previous lane's `sniff_compression()` is now fixed, and with
  it fixed, **this ROM's NARCs contain no confirmed genuine BIOS-Huffman or
  BIOS-RLE compressed sub-file** -- see "Huffman/RLE decoder verification"
  above. The trainer-sprite wrapper in `a/0/0/6` (previously thought to be
  Huffman4) is NOT BIOS-Huffman-compressed; its real format is still
  unknown and needs a fresh investigation (byte-level structure inspection,
  cross-referencing the ARM9 loader) that this pass did not have budget for.
- `tools/assets/verify_compression.py` (new) re-runs the Huffman4/Huffman8/
  RLE round-trip check over the whole ROM; re-run it if `narc.py`'s sniff or
  decoders change.

### Trainer sprite wrapper: first look

Sub-files 0, 1 and 100 of `a/0/0/6` (NitroFS file id 248 per
`extract/manifest.json`) were extracted to `build/assets/` and hex-dumped.
All three share the same 64-byte-visible header layout (offsets in bytes,
values little-endian):

| offset | aps_0 (0x10BC B) | aps_1 (0x2174 B) | aps_100 (0x224C B) | guess |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00-0x07 | `" APS12_1"` | same | same | 8-byte ASCII magic/version tag, constant across all sampled sub-files |
| 0x08 | `0x00010001` | `0x00020002` | `0x00080001` | two u16: low16 and high16 both look like counts (1/1, 2/2, 8/1) -- possibly (sub-object count, frame count) or similar |
| 0x0C | `0x00000000` | same | same | reserved/padding |
| 0x10 | `0x78` (120) | `0x10c` (268) | `0x64` (100) | size of a leading chunk (not obviously proportional to the count field) |
| 0x14 | `0x1024` (4132) | `0x2048` (8264) | `0x21c8` (8648) | size of a second, larger chunk |
| 0x18 | `0x98` (152) | `0x12c` (300) | `0x84` (132) | size of a trailing chunk |
| 0x1C | `0x00000000` | same | same | reserved |
| 0x20 | `0x00004702` | `0x00014701` | `0x0020c800` | unclear; low byte differs, does not look like a plain size |
| 0x24-0x2C | all zero | all zero | all zero | reserved/padding |
| 0x30 onward | `0x1000`, `0x1c8d`, ... | `0xbe5`, `0x169a`, ... | `0x1000`, `0`, ... | more size-like or count-like fields, not yet decoded |
| last 4 bytes | `0x10000000` | `0x10000000` | `0x10000000` | constant sentinel/type word across all three samples |

The field at offset 0x14 plus the field at offset 0x18 equals the total
sub-file size exactly for all three samples (0x1024+0x98=0x10BC,
0x2048+0x12c=0x2174, 0x21c8+0x84=0x224c), so the wrapper appears to be a
two-chunk container (a larger payload chunk followed by a smaller trailer
chunk), with the offset-0x10 field as a possible third/leading chunk size
that is not part of that sum. No LZ77/LZ11/Huffman/RLE tag byte was found
immediately after the header (the previous "Huffman4" sniff hit was the
`" APS"` magic itself, not a real compression tag -- see above).

Searched the full 4284/8564/8780-byte dumps for `NCGR`/`RGCN` and
`NCLR`/`RLCN` magics (both orientations): none found in any of the three
samples. So this is not a NARC-in-NARC or a plain NDS graphics container
wrapped in a custom prefix -- the pixel/palette data, if present, is raw
and un-tagged. Consistent with that: aps_0 and aps_1 both end in the bytes
`... ff 7f 00 00`, and `0x7FFF` is the standard BGR555 "white" sentinel,
suggesting an embedded raw 16-bit palette tail (aps_100, with count field
8/1 instead of 1/1, has substantially more non-zero trailing bytes instead
of ending on a single `7fff`, consistent with multiple palette-like
entries for a multi-object record). This is circumstantial, not confirmed.

**Loader search.** Grepped `asm/arm9/src/*.s` and `src/matched/*.c` for:
the NitroFS file id `248`/`0xF8` (too common a small integer to be useful
-- 29 `.s` files contain a bare `248`, none obviously related), the
sub-file count `733`/`0x2DD`, the path string `a/0/0/6`, and the magic
word `0x53504120` (`" APS"`) as a `.word`/`.4byte` literal. None of the
count, path-string, or magic-word searches produced any hits anywhere in
`asm/arm9/src` or `src/matched`. This is consistent with the archive being
opened by numeric NitroFS file id resolved through a runtime table (not a
literal path string or magic compiled into ARM9 code), and/or with the
actual loader function not yet being present in `asm/arm9/src` or
`src/matched` (513 matched `.c` files and 119 `.s` files exist, but this
project is still early in decomp coverage). No loader candidate function
was identified in this pass; finding it will likely require tracing
NitroFS file-id-to-archive resolution generically (e.g. via the
`data/a/0/0/*` sibling archives that are already better understood, or via
whatever function opens `a/0/0/7`'s NCGR-containing NARC, since `a/0/0/6`
and `a/0/0/7` are adjacent trainer-sprite-related archives) rather than by
grepping for constants specific to `a/0/0/6`.
